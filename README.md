# PokemonGracidea

## Region Description
The Events of PokemonGracidea take place in a Region not far away from Unova. The region is still affected by something known as the "Gracidea Incident" where the Protector of the Gracidea clashed with its destroyer, leaving the region in a destroyes state. Neither to Goddess, nor the Protector or destroyer has been seen ever since.

## Dmg Calc
Can you use the Showdown Dmg Calc for this game? You can, but as you can see in the Change Log, we've changed a lot of things, so in order for the rolls to be correct, we built our own Dmg Calc with the same Data as in the Game in the Background. 
The functionality is similar to that of the Showdown one, however, we've tried to make it visually more appealing ;D

### Will there be any Plans to implement real Pokemon Data?
Since there is an Pokemon API, there is a high possibility, that it's pretty easy to implement pokemon data from the game, however, the current focus is on the Calc for the Game

## Is there a Rom to the game?
Currently speaking, nope, I, Kyo - the main programmer for this project - am not skilled enough to craft a Rom, however, if I manage to understand everything needed, there is a high possibility I'll be able to create a Rom
