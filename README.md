## Dmg Calc
Can you use the Showdown Dmg Calc for this game? You can, but as you can see in the Change Log, we've changed a lot of things, so in order for the rolls to be correct, we built our own Dmg Calc with the same Data as in the Game in the Background. 
The functionality is similar to that of the Showdown one, however, we've tried to make it visually more appealing ;D
